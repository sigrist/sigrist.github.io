I code Java since 1998, when I was doing my Science Computer degree. I took my first Java Certification when Java 1.4 was released in February 2002. Since then, I pass through a lot of libraries and frameworks like AWT, Swing, Struts, JSP, JSF, EJB and finally Spring Framework. The last one looks like our ally, it is easy to build a **Service** class, some **Components** and abuse of Design Patterns like **Facades**. Then I started to read more about OOP, specially [Yegor Bugayenko](https://www.yegor256.com) blog, and then I realized that I was doing it wrong.

Reading Yegor books, [Elegant Objects vol I and II](https://www.yegor256.com/books.html), and his posts, I realized my mistake. Using Spring it is easy to create anemics objects and create a lot of **Service** classes to do the objects jobs.

With this blog I want to share how hard is to change from the Spring approach to something close to real OOP.



And yes, I read 256 Blog Hacks from Yeagor and copied his blog template.
