I code Java since 1998, when I was doing my Science Computer degree. I took my first Java Certification when Java 1.4 was released in February 2002. Since then, I pass through a lot of libraries and frameworks like AWT, Swing, Struts, JSP, JSF, EJB and finally Spring Framework. The last one looks like our ally, it is easy to build a **Service** class, some **Components** and abuse of Design Patterns like **Facades**. Then I started to read more about OOP, and then I realized that I was doing it wrong.

With this blog I want to share my studies about new technologies and OOP real OOP.
