This is the second post. It does not really make
any sense, just demonstrates how this blog renders multiple posts. You can add
more files to the `_posts` directory and they all will be visible
here. Just make sure you name them right. See how existing files
are named and do the same.

There is no real meaning here, just a second post, to help
us see how the blog behaves with multiple posts. Pay attention
how files are named.
